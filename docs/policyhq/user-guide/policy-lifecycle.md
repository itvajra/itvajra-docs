# Policy Lifecycle

This page explains how policies move through statuses from creation to retirement.

## Common statuses

- Draft: created but not submitted for approval
- PendingApproval: awaiting review by a Policy Approver
- ChangesRequested: approver sent it back for updates
- Approved: approved and available for distribution or export
- Effective: active policy in effect (if used by your org)
- PendingReview: due for periodic review
- Retired: removed from active circulation

## Typical flow

1) Author or Admin creates a policy draft.
2) Draft is submitted for review.
3) Approver either approves or requests changes.
4) Approved policies are published and assigned to users.
5) Over time, policies enter review cycles or are retired.

## Versions

- Each edit creates a new version.
- The latest version is the active version for review and acknowledgements.
- Version history remains available in policy details.
