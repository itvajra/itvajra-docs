# FAQ

## Do I need to acknowledge every policy?

Only policies assigned to you with acknowledgements required will appear in your Pending list.

## Can I edit a policy after approval?

Yes. Editing creates a new version, which may require approval depending on your org settings.

## Why can't I approve a policy?

Only Policy Approvers (and certain admins) can approve or request changes.

## Can I import users without creating new business units?

If the CSV includes a business unit name that does not exist, PolicyHQ will create it during import. To avoid this, match existing unit names exactly.
