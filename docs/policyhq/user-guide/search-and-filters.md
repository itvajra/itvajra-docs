# Search and Filters

Most list pages support search and filtering. Use these tools to quickly find records.

## Search

- Search field: matches titles and metadata
- Content search: scans the full policy text (slower but more thorough)

## Common filters

- Business unit
- Category
- Status (Draft, Approved, etc.)
- Date ranges (reports and audit logs)

## Sorting

Most lists support sorting by:

- Due date
- Date acknowledged
- Last updated

Tip: Use search first, then filters, and finish with sorting to narrow results quickly.
