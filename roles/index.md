# Roles Overview

PolicyHQ uses role-based access control. Your role determines which pages appear in the sidebar and which actions you can take.

Roles in the system:
- OrgUser
- PolicyApprover
- OrgAdmin
- ConsultantAdmin
- SuperAdmin
- AuditorReadOnly

How roles are assigned:
- Roles are managed by administrators or the platform team via Microsoft Entra ID app roles.
- A user-org mapping in the database can override the token role for day-to-day access.

Primary navigation areas:
- My Workplace: `Policies to Acknowledge`, `Policies to Approve`
- Management: `Policies`, `Templates`, `Org Profile`, `Business Units`, `Exports`, `Reports`, `Audit & Logs`

Use the role pages below for responsibilities, permissions, and step-by-step actions.
